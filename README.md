GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/Shivansh-00/Python-ML-model](https://github.com/Shivansh-00/Python-ML-model)

## 💡 Features

- Predicts calories burned using machine learning
- User-friendly web interface built with HTML and CSS
- Flask-powered Python backend to handle predictions
- Trained ML model stored as a `.pkl` file
- Responsive design with simple and clear UI

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python** (ML model, backend)
- **scikit-learn** (for training the ML model)
- **Flask** (for building the web server)
- **HTML & CSS** (for frontend)
- **Pickle** (for saving and loading the trained model)
